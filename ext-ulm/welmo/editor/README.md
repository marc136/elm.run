# Elm Home Page

All of [elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org) is written in Elm!


## Build Instructions

Running `bash build.sh` should generate the static website in `_site`.

After that, you can run `(cd _site ; elm reactor)` to see it at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Not all the links work with this setup, but you should be able to get to all the pages nonetheless!
