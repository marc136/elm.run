# README

After the experiments in 

1. ../build-wasm-with-cabal/
2. ../elm-js-compiler/
3. ../mdgriffith_elm-dev/ext-ulm/
4. ../mdgriffith_elm-dev/ext-ulm/welmo

I will start again fresh from a clean slate.

I will clone the official Elm compiler and try to keep the file size minimal for now.  
The extensions (except for the `Show` implementations and helpers from Mario) won't be part of the repo for now.
